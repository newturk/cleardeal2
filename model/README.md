This directory contains scripts and artifacts for training and storing the machine learning model used in the AI Lead Intent Score Dashboard.

- Place all training scripts (e.g., `train_model.py`) and model files (e.g., `.pkl`) here.
- Only use synthetic or open data for training; do not include real PII.
- Document model choices and feature engineering for transparency and reproducibility.
